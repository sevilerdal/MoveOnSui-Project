# SUIChess

### I used Remix IDE to develop and test this application. I was inspired to create a base for an online chess game. 
- For creating user cards, I used code from workshop and I tried to develop a level updating funtion.
- Due to errors, I was not able to properly test the code. I was able to compile without error. When I tried testing, I did not have any errors. There were only warnings, and they were not in my code but it seemed to be on root (?) folders.

#### Player
- Has a name, image, rank and level
- Level updates with update_level function
